# Southern Arm Control Setup > objects > tower1

This folder holds all of the object description files for the world. These objects will be moved to the .gazebo/models folder in the home folder.

## Files
### model-1_3.sdf
* The model description file for sdf version 1.3.

### model-1_4.sdf
* The model description file for sdf version 1.4.

### model.sdf
* The model description file for other versions of sdf.

### model.config
* The configuration information for the folder.

## Folders
### Meshes
* Holds the dae files used to display the objects.

## Notes
* .dae files and other 3d files can be easily modified by using the 3D Builder app in the current version of Windows 10.
* The files and format for this folder has been heavily modified from one of the models included with Gazebo (most are very alike).
* When including these models in the world a scaling factor had to be added to get them to the real size, they should be only about 10*x mm.
